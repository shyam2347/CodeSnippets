CodeSnippets
============

I will collect some nice code snippets in this repository

Some Tips
=========
1) Never mix logical AND and logical OR in an expression. Logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR.
2) When using mixed data types in expression, this is the order of precedence
Long double (highest)
Double
Float
Unsigned long int
Long int
Unsigned int
Int (lowest)
Ex:  2 + 3.14159 ==> 2.0 + 3.14159
