============

I will collect some nice code snippets in this repository

Some Tips
=========
1) Never mix logical AND and logical OR in an expression. Logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR. <br/>
2) When using mixed data types in expression, this is the order of precedence <br/>
Long double (highest) <br/>
Double <br/>
Float <br/>
Unsigned long int <br/>
Long int <br/>
Unsigned int <br/>
Int (lowest) <br/>
Ex:  2 + 3.14159 ==> 2.0 + 3.14159 <br/>
Char and short are always implicitly promoted to integers <br/>
